<br/>
My name is LÃ©a, a student at <a> Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)</a>. I am from Korea, and I speak Korean, English, Chinese, and a bit of French. My major is <a>School of Computing</a> at KAIST, but I am staying in Paris from September 2017 to boost up my French skills. This blog will cover my life in Paris, from beginning to the end. The quotidien tab contains short writings on random themes. It only exists to practice my embarrassing French writing skills, so you can ignore it.
